## About 

**hue-tui** is a tui *(Terminal User Interface)* that allows for easy control of your Philips Hue lights. It uses my Hue-API library [hue-snek](https://github.com/channel-42/hue-snek) to communicate with the bridge.

## Installation

Install hue-tui with:   

`pip install huetui`

This should fetch all the necesary dependencies. Nevertheless, make sure that all dependencies are installed.

Launch hui-tui by typing `huetui` into your terminal.   

>Should you get the error `command not found: huetui`, restart your terminal. Should the error persist, check that `$HOME/.local/bin` is in your `$PATH`. This can be done by adding `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` to your .bashrc/.zshrc.

### Dependencies

- python3\

The following dependencies should be downloaded automatically when installing via pip. If you're cloning the repo, make sure to manually install them.

- hue-snek  --> `pip install hue-snek-channel42`
- py_cui    --> `pip install py-cui`
- Pillow    --> `pip install Pillow`
- colormath --> `pip install colormath`

## Setup process

To be able to use hue-tui, you need to have your bridge's IP address and a API username. The IP address can be found by e.g. going into your routers network tab and looking for a device with hostname "Philips-hue". To get an API username, check out [this](https://developers.meethue.com/develop/get-started-2/) short guide on the official Hue-Developers site.

Once you have the IP address and unsername, you can start hue-tui by typin `huetui` into a terminal. This should open the first-time-setup, where you can input your IP and username.

> Tip: pasting with e.g. CTRL-SHIFT-V works (check what the pasting binding is in your specific terminal emulator) 

To input your IP, navigate the cursor to the IP textfield (it should be there by default) and press ENTER. Then type or paste your bridge's IP address **without http://** at the begining. 

> E.g.: 192.168.178.20

Exit out of the textfield by pressing ESC and move your cursor to the username field. Enter your username just like before and then move your cursor to the big "make login" button. Press ENTER and a popup showing your IP and username should appear. Press ENTER to dismiss the popup and restart huetui by exiting out of the programm (press q).    

After re-opening hue-tui you should see all your lights, groups, scenes, etc. like in the screenshot at the top.
